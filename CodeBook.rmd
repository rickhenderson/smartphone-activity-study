## Project Description
This project deals with tidying up a dataset and implifying some tables to produce a set of data useful for analysis, as well as a dataset containing average values calculated by subject and activity. The data comes from a study of human movement recorded by sensors from a smartphone.

##Study design and data processing

###Collection of the raw data
The raw data for this project was collected by researchers at University of California Irving (UCI) Center for Machine Learning and Intelligent Systems.

A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained can be found here:

[http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)

The raw data can be downloaded as a zip file from here:
[https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip)

This file should be unzipped into a subfolder called _data_ inside the folder where the analysis will take place (the folder where the analysis file gets downloaded to and where it will be executed from.

###Notes on the original (raw) data 
The site listed above explains the study in detail and the README file provided in the data set explains how the original data raw data ways collected as well as how other variables not used in this project were calculated.

##Creating the tidy datafile

###Guide to create the tidy data file
Description on how to create the tidy data file (1. download the data, ...)/

###Cleaning of the data
Short, high-level description of what the cleaning script does. [link to the readme document that describes the code in greater detail]()

This data is the long form as mentioned in the rubric as either long or wide form is acceptable.

* Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set
  * Before the training and test sets could be merged, combine the y\_train.txt file with the X\_train.txt using `cbind()` to add a variable to the train data that indicates which activity was being performed.
  * Combine y\_test.txt file with the data in the X\_test.txt file using `cbind()` to add a variable to the test data that indicates which activity was being peformed.

##Description of the variables in the tiny_data.txt file
General description of the file including:
 - Dimensions of the dataset
 - Summary of the data
 - Variables present in the dataset

(you can easily use Rcode for this, just load the dataset and provide the information directly form the tidy data file)

###Variable 1 (repeat this section for all variables in the dataset)
Short description of what the variable describes.

Some information on the variable including:
 - Class of the variable
 - Unique values/levels of the variable
 - Unit of measurement (if no unit of measurement list this as well)
 - In case names follow some schema, describe how entries were constructed (for example time-body-gyroscope-z has 4 levels of descriptors. Describe these 4 levels). 

(you can easily use Rcode for this, just load the dataset and provide the information directly form the tidy data file)
