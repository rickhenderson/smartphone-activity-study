## Project Description
This project deals with tidying up a dataset and simplifying some tables to produce a set of data useful for analysis. It also entails creating a __tidy__ dataset containing average values calculated by __subject__ and __activity__. The data comes from a study of human movement recorded by sensors from a smartphone.

In this document, __subject__ means a subject that took part in the original study, or an identifying number, and __activity__ refers to an activity performed by the subject during the study, or a descriptive word or value used in the dataset to represent the activity.

##Study Design and Data Processing

###Collection of the raw data
The raw data for this project was collected by researchers at University of California Irving (UCI) Center for Machine Learning and Intelligent Systems.

A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained can be found here:

[http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)

The raw data can be downloaded as a zip file from here:
[https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip)

This file should be unzipped into a subfolder called _ucidata_ inside the folder where the analysis will take place (the folder where the analysis file gets downloaded to and where it will be executed from).

###Notes on the original (raw) data 
The site listed above explains the study in detail and the README file provided in the data set explains how the original, raw data was collected as well as how other variables not used in this project were calculated.

##Creating the Tidy Datafile

###Guide to create the tidy data file
Description on how to create the tidy data file (1. download the data, ...)/

###Cleaning of the data
Short, high-level description of what the cleaning script does. [link to the readme document that describes the code in greater detail]()

This data is the long form as mentioned in the rubric as either long or wide form is acceptable.

* Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set
  * Before the training and test sets could be merged, combine the y\_train.txt file with the X\_train.txt using `cbind()` to add a variable to the train data that indicates which activity was being performed.
  * Combine y\_test.txt file with the data in the X\_test.txt file using `cbind()` to add a variable to the test data that indicates which activity was being peformed.

##Description of the variables in the _avg\_by\_actsub\_tidy.csv_ file
* Dimensions: 180 rows x 81 columns

* Variables in the data set:
  * __subjectID__: A value between 1 and 30 indicating the subject who performed the activity in the original study.
  * __activityID__: A descriptive word describing the activity that the subject peformed. Possible values were: 
    * WALKING\_UPSTAIRS
    * WALKING\_DOWNSTAIRS
    * WALKING
    * STANDING
    * SITTING
    * LAYING

The remaining __79__ variables were extracted from the original list of _561_ variables by using the `grep` command to find only those variables that contained the strings 'mean()' and 'std()'. This provided only the variables that calculated a _mean_ and _standard deviation_ for the data collected during the study. This __purposefully excluded__ variables such as _fBodyAccJerk-meanFreq()-Y_ and _angle(X,gravityMean)_ which were included in the original data set, but were not of interest for this project.

The other variables and their descriptions can be found in the README for the original data set by following the link provided to the UCI study.
